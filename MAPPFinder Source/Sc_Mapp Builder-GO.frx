ÿ?This MAPP is built based on the Gene Ontology hierarchy 
(www.geneontology.org). The MAPP contains the genes 
associated with this GO term and the genes associated with all of 
the children of this term. For human data the MAPPs are based on 
the SwissProt gene associations, for mouse the MGI associations 
are used, and for yeast the SGD associations are used. The gene 
association files were downloaded February 14, 2002. Individual 
MAPPs are not made for terms with less than 5 genes associated, 
but those terms will appear on the MAPP for their parent term.
